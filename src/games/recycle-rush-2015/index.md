# Robobobobobobobobobobo
This year had the last members who were around during the year that our team made it to Nationals. We had a lot of experience that was passed down and kept our team alive even if we didn't win much more.

Recycle Rush was a tough year for us. The competition was very limited in terms of things that we could do but that was no excuse for our team.

Overall we could have our protoypes more as to try and make a reliable mechanism to pick up many totes.
