# Our Plan

This year we are focusing heavily on the quality of our Robot. Electrical and Software already have a great headstart on autonomous code. Mechanical is planning to have two kitbots, one for driving the other for the E/S team.

Our plan is to make the most viable prototypes early on as to try and get the best strategy possible by the end of the season.
