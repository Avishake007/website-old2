The Build Season has begun. There are four teams: Logistics, Mechanical, Communications and Software. Software is busy updating the roboRIO (main brain of the robot), making sure the Talons connect to roboRIO, updating firmware, adding an encoder, troubleshooting and trying not to electrocute themselves. Mechanical is working hard building a model for the field of play, and also build a basic chassis for the robot. Logistics is working on finances and budget. Communications members are busy writing a blog, fleshing out the website, and tuning all the bells and whistles.
