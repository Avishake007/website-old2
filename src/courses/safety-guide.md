# Safety Guidelines

At no point should someone feel unsafe or in danger of being in bodily harm. If someone were to feel this way they should immediately tell a mentor or a team lead so they can stop the problem from escalating.
At all points when a member is inside the Robotics Room they must be wearing safety glasses regardless of what is going inside the room.
Mentors and team leads should naturally be responsible and keep the culture of safety current.
No machines should be left running without a member attending it. Do not point knives, drills or other dangerous items at people or yourself.
Do not make improvised hand saws. Tell people when you get injured. Do not wash your injury alone behind a wall where nobody can see you.
